# Teleport

:pushpin: Teleport is currently under development!

Teleport is a customizable VR experience that lets you escape from your everyday and travel to different places. Using the mystical powers given to you, you can change your ambience music, mood lighting and environment. Then, sit back and relax.

## To Do

As development progresses, Teleport is set to have the following features:

- Three different controls to change: music, lighting, environment/scene
- The controls will be primitive shapes
- When a control is selected, it will appear in front of the user with 2D UI
- The user makes changes by changing the color/appearance of the control

### On Mobile
